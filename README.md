# Build Stage

## Overview
The Build stage is about compiling the source code and generating a deployable artifact. This ensures the application is ready for testing and deployment.

**To build the application run the following command:**

```
mvn clean install
```

This will compile the code and generate the deployable artifact (a Jar file) in the `target` directory.

## Next Steps

Move on to the `test` branch to validate the applicationâ€™s behavior.
```
git checkout test
```
