# Test Stage

## Overview
The Test stage ensures that the application works as expected. Automated tests help catch bugs early and give confidence in the code before deploying.

**To run the application tests run the following command:**

```
mvn test
```

Review the output and ensure all tests pass.

## Next Steps

Once tests are passing, move to the `release` branch to run the application and make it accessible.
```
git chekout release
```
