# DevOps

DevOps is a set of practices that bridges the gap between development and operations teams. 
It focuses on automation, collaboration, and continuous delivery to build, test, release, 
and monitor software faster and more reliably.

In this project, each step of the DevOps cycle is represented by a **dedicated Git branch**, 
so you can follow the process in a clear and organized way.

To begin, check out the Plan stage:
```git checkout plan```
